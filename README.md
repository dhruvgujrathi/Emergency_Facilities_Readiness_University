A simulation is an inexact impersonation of an activity of a procedure or system; that speaks to its activity after some time. Simulation is utilized in numerous unique circumstances. Simulation is a way of modelling where the developed model closely matches the real-world scenarios. By observing these scenarios, researches gain insights into the real world to generate probabilities and to use it in the real world for getting high success rates. Simulations can also be understood as a kind of imitation of the situation. For example, simulation technology is used in motor driving schools where the learners can drive the car in a simulator to learn the basics of car driving like operating the car, driving the car in busy streets, etc. which has been created using simulation. Developing the real world scenarios can be done using the data gathered during the contextual enquiry activities. Building scenarios is highly useful for the success of the simulated model.
